### Vectors

## Why ?

 I made this simple vector implementation after a little school project in which
 we had to make (fixed-size) lists in C. 
 I found it fun and wanted to explore further the concept, and here it is.

## How?

 The main vector itself has a polymorphic purpose, and is intended to 
 be wrapped for type casting (see in examples/int_wrapping.c)
